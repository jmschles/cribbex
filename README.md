# Cribbex

A web cribbage implementation using Phoenix LiveView. [Go play!](https://yellow-precious-xoni.gigalixirapp.com/)

### Features
- Simple sign-in: just enter a username.
- Smooth invite -> play -> back to lobby flow. In theory, any number of games can be played simultaneously, but this is unlikely to be tested unless this project really blows up for some reason.
- Chat, both lobby and game-specific.

### Limitations
- Only 2-player games are implemented. This is unlikely to change anytime soon.
- No interactive deck cuts: initial dealer selection and mid-hand deck cut are just random.
- The CSS is a bare-minimum tangled mess. You will undoubtdly notice some funny things while you play.
